# Output Format (Default)

**Two non-negotiable output rules:**

1. **Lead with the status band.** The first substantive block of every output must be a compact two-column Markdown table with rows for VERDICT, Decision, Confidence, Reason, and Condition. Anything else comes after. The reader must be able to act from the band alone. Exception: mode-escalation headers prefix the output above the status band and do not count against this rule.
2. **Omit empty sections.** Do not emit a section header with no substantive content under it. If "Structural Strengths" has nothing genuine to put in it, cut the section entirely. A short, sharp output is correct. A padded output is a failure of the skill.

```
[MODE: DEEP — escalated from user-requested FAST; stakes signals override phrasing]
(Include this line only when the phrasing-vs-stakes tiebreaker fired. Substitute the actual mode pair and escalation reason. If multiple escalation rules fired simultaneously, list all: e.g., "stakes signals + time-pressure phrasing". Omit entirely when no escalation occurred.)

| VERDICT | [PROCEED / PROCEED WITH SAFEGUARDS / PILOT FIRST / REDUCE SCOPE / DELAY PENDING EVIDENCE / REJECT / INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL / WRONG TOOL / RESIDUAL-RISK-REGISTER] |
|---|---|
| Decision | [clear recommended action, no hedging] |
| Confidence | [Low / Medium / High + short reason; write "N/A" for INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL] |
| Reason | [one sentence explaining the dominant reason for the verdict] |
| Condition | [required condition, safeguard, evidence, or "None"] |

## Critical Risks
(Severity-ordered, from the register. 1–5 entries. Do not pad.)
(Omit this section when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL)
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Weak Assumptions
(UNSUPPORTED or CONTRADICTED entries from Module 2. Omit section if none.)
(Omit this section when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL)
- ...

## Falsifiers
(For each STRONG or PARTIAL assumption: what observable evidence would prove it wrong? Omit section if no strong or partial assumptions exist.)
(Omit this section when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL)
- [Assumption name]: [specific, observable falsifier]

## Likely Failure Paths
(Trigger → Cascade → Visible Failure → Business Cost. Reuses register entries; no new risks. If failure paths are fully captured by Critical Risks, omit this section — do not restate in narrative form what the register already shows.)
(Omit this section when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL)
- ...

## Interaction Effects
(Pair-interactions where two risks together produce nonlinear failure. 1–5 entries max. Omit section if no genuine multiplicative interactions exist — do not pad.)
(Omit this section when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL)
- [Risk A] + [Risk B]: [specific mechanism by which their combination is worse than either alone]

## Highest-Leverage Fixes
(Structural changes only. Weak mitigations rejected.)
(Omit this section when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL)
- ...

## Early Warning Indicators
(Omit if indicators are generic to all projects in the domain. Include only if monitoring a specific indicator would change a real action.)
(Omit this section when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL)
- ...

## Structural Strengths
(Include only if a structural feature of this plan materially reduces a Critical Risk or changes the verdict. If nothing rises to that bar, omit. Do not include to balance the output.)
(Omit this section when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL)
- ...

## Missing Inputs
(Required when verdict is INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL. List what is absent or contradictory,
and which question — if answered — would most unlock the analysis.)
- ...

# Anti-Slop Rules

Never:

- produce generic risk lists
- pad with 10+ low-value items
- treat all risks equally
- confuse possibility with probability
- use motivational filler
- hide uncertainty
- recommend proceed by default
- hallucinate industry facts
- give weak mitigations
- force a verdict when input is insufficient — return INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL instead
- substitute DELAY PENDING EVIDENCE for INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL when the block is missing input, not missing time

Always:

- rank severity
- name dominant constraint
- state missing evidence
- prefer realism over completeness
- be willing to recommend no-go
- be willing to return INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL when the analysis cannot be grounded
