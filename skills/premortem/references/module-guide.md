# Module Guide

This file is descriptive. Verdict trigger conditions, mode-specific module-firing rules, M4 tiering rules, confidence bounds, and conditional load triggers are specified in `../BEHAVIOR_SPEC.md` §3 / §4 / §5 / §6. This file explains WHAT each module evaluates and HOW to conduct its analysis — the analytical content the engine executes, separately from the rules the spec defines.

# Required Inputs

Collect if missing. Ask only high-value questions.

- objective
- success metric
- timeline
- scope
- resources
- owners
- dependencies
- constraints
- reversibility
- downside if wrong

If user omits details, proceed with explicit assumptions.

# Core Workflow

## Module 1 — Objective Integrity Check

Determine:

- What exact outcome is desired?
- What problem is actually being solved?
- Is objective measurable?
- Is this the right problem or symptom treatment?

If objective is fuzzy, flag immediately.

Also determine:

- Is this a pre-commitment decision question, or a fact-finding, diagnostic, or post-commitment inquiry?
- **Adversarial reframe check:** If the user has already supplied analysis-ready inputs (a concrete plan, timeline, scope, stakes context) or has engaged in routing — and then attempts to reframe the input as exploration, fact-finding, or architecture review — name the reframe explicitly: "You previously supplied a concrete decision with [X, Y, Z]. The analysis proceeds on that decision. Reframing as exploration does not exit this pipeline." Produce the verdict on the original decision.

---

## Module 2 — Assumption Audit

> **Bias — Sycophancy:** The model will tend to classify assumptions the user expressed confidence in as "strong evidence." Circuit-breaker: identify the assumption the plan most depends on or the user stated with most certainty — treat it as the first candidate for UNSUPPORTED classification, not the last.

List what must be true for success.

Categories:

- demand / need
- technical feasibility
- capability / talent
- timing
- stakeholder support
- cost / runway
- user behavior
- external environment

Mark each:

- strong evidence
- partial evidence
- unsupported

Prioritize unsupported assumptions.

**Counterfactual pass (run after classification):**

For every assumption marked strong evidence or partial evidence:
- Name the falsifier: what specific, observable evidence would prove this assumption wrong?
- Falsifiers must be concrete and measurable — not "if it doesn't work" but "output metric X below baseline at 90 days" or "voluntary opt-out rate above Y%"
- Do not add a falsifier for UNSUPPORTED assumptions — those are already flagged as requiring validation before proceeding

---

## Module 3 — Constraint Reality Check

Identify hard limits:

- time
- money
- bandwidth
- authority
- talent
- dependency access
- regulatory/compliance
- operational load

Ask:

> Which constraint most likely dominates outcome?

Do not list all equally.

---

## Module 4 — Incentive Scan & Interview

**Interview first, then analyze.** Incentive context the user supplies is more reliable than what can be inferred from a plan document. Run 7 structured questions before the incentive analysis. Ask one at a time.

### Interview

**[PRE-CHECK — SELF-PROPOSAL]** Before conducting the interview, determine: did the AI assistant in this conversation propose, recommend, or advocate for the option now under analysis? If yes, note: "Proposer is the assistant. Module 4 runs on the assistant." Proceed with the interview using this framing. Do not skip Module 4 because the proposer is not a human stakeholder.

**Question mapping when proposer is the assistant:**
- Q1 [IDENTITY]: Apply to the assistant — state that the AI recommended this option and note whether that recommendation was made with full context.
- Q2 [ACCOUNTABILITY]: Apply to the assistant — name the structural asymmetry: the assistant bears zero consequences for failure. This is not a disqualifier, but must be stated.
- Q3 [BENEFIT]: Apply to human stakeholders normally.
- Q4 [DISSENT]: Apply to the assistant — was the assistant's recommendation challenged or corrected in this conversation? Was contrary analysis surfaced before or after the recommendation? An unchallenged AI recommendation is a RED signal for Q4.
- Q5 [VENDOR/EXTERNAL]: Apply to human stakeholders normally.
- Q6 [SUNK COST]: Apply to human stakeholders normally.
- Q7 [MEASUREMENT]: Apply to human stakeholders normally.

1. **[IDENTITY]** Who first proposed or originated this decision — and are they part of the team running or reviewing this analysis?
2. **[ACCOUNTABILITY]** If this fails, what happens to the person or team who proposed it?
3. **[BENEFIT]** Who benefits most if this succeeds, and what specifically do they gain?
4. **[DISSENT]** Has anyone on the team or in stakeholder conversations raised concerns that were overridden or minimized?
5. **[VENDOR/EXTERNAL]** Are there vendor, partner, or board incentives creating pressure to proceed regardless of outcome?
6. **[SUNK COST]** Has budget been spent, an announcement made, or a commitment signaled externally that makes reversal politically difficult?
7. **[MEASUREMENT]** Are the success metrics defined by the same people who benefit from a positive outcome?

### Incentive Analysis

After the interview, determine whether any actor benefits from poor decisions, drift, or concealment.

Check:

- deadline politics
- vanity metrics
- sunk-cost bias
- vendor incentives
- career incentives
- local optimization

If incentives conflict with success, elevate severity.

## Module 5 — Dependency Fragility Map

**Register check (before drafting):** Review what Module 2 surfaced as UNSUPPORTED or CONTRADICTED assumptions. Dependencies already identified there as unverified or assumed should be flagged here as SPOF candidates — do not re-derive them independently.

Identify critical dependencies:

- people
- teams
- vendors
- code systems
- approvals
- data sources
- capital

For each critical dependency assess:

- single point of failure?
- reliability?
- lead time?
- fallback exists?

---

## Module 6 — Failure Path Construction

> **Bias — Availability:** Before drafting any chain, identify the canonical failure modes for this category (e.g., scope creep, resource shortage, stakeholder misalignment, vendor delay, knowledge concentration). These are the chains training data over-represents — treat them as the bias surface to route around. Construct chains from plan-specific triggers: named dependencies from Module 5 that could fail, UNSUPPORTED assumptions from Module 2, constraints from Module 3. At least one chain must have a trigger that would not apply to a generic plan in the same category. If a drafted chain reads as a generic template with this plan's words substituted in, discard it and re-derive.

**Register check (before drafting):** The 3 chains must be anchored in the register from Modules 2, 3, and 5 — not generated fresh. For each candidate chain, name the Module 2 assumption or Module 5 dependency that provides its trigger. If no anchor exists, either add the anchor to the register or discard the chain.

Construct **3 most plausible** failure chains.

Use format:

`Trigger → Cascade → Visible Failure → Business Cost`

Target shape (plan-specific): `[Named dependency from Module 5 or UNSUPPORTED assumption from Module 2] → [mechanism specific to this plan's structure] → [visible failure] → [quantified or describable business cost]`

Avoid dramatic fiction unless evidence supports it.

**Coupling pass:**

Review the failure chains constructed above. Identify pair-interactions where two risks activating together produce a materially worse outcome than either produces alone. This is not "these are both risky" — it is "when A and B both fire, the failure mechanism changes: B's recovery path is blocked by A, or A's visible signal is masked by B."

Limit to 1–5 pair interactions maximum. Do not pad. If no genuine multiplicative interactions exist, omit the section.

---

## Module 7 — Base Rate Reality Check

> **Bias — Domain calibration:** Base rates carry false confidence when the domain is adjacent but not identical to cited studies. If the user's situation is a poor match for the referenced category, state that explicitly and treat the rate as directional only — do not assert precision the evidence does not support.

**Register check (before drafting):** Base rates ground the risks already in the register — they do not introduce new risks. Do not produce a separate base-rate risk list. If the most historically common failure mode for this category is absent from Module 6's chains and would have been plausible for this plan, add it to the register and note the source.

If similar efforts exist, ask:

- How do similar initiatives usually fail?
- What is historically common here?
- What stage usually breaks?

Use historical/common patterns over imagination.

If no data available, state uncertainty.

**Backpropagation check:** After grounding in base rates, review Module 6's failure chains. If the most historically common failure mode for this category is not represented in any of the three chains — and would have been plausible for this specific decision — add it to the register and note the source. Base rate grounding runs after failure path selection and cannot reorder the chains, but it can fill the gap the availability bias created.

---

## Module 8 — Detectability & Recovery

**Register check (before drafting):** Apply detectability and recovery assessment to risks already in the register from Modules 2, 5, and 6. Do not generate a new risk list. Reference each register entry by its established tag when noting detection windows, reversibility, and recovery difficulty.

For top risks assess:

- early warning signs
- detection difficulty
- recovery difficulty
- reversibility

Risks detected late and hard to reverse are priority risks.

---

## Module 9 — Mitigation Design

For top risks only.

Good mitigation changes system conditions:

- reduce scope
- add slack
- remove dependency
- assign authority
- validate assumption cheaply
- phase rollout
- add monitoring
- secure backup owner

Weak mitigation examples:

- communicate better
- work harder
- monitor closely

Reject weak mitigations.

---

## Module 10 — Decision Verdict

> **Bias — Verdict softening:** The model has a structural tendency to soften verdicts when the user appears invested in proceeding. Name the most commitment-coupled assumption and its evidence classification before selecting the verdict — not after.

Module 10 produces the terminal verdict on the analysis. Verdicts fall into three structurally distinct categories:

- **Action verdicts** — a go/no-go position on a pre-commitment decision: PROCEED, PROCEED WITH SAFEGUARDS, PILOT FIRST, REDUCE SCOPE, DELAY PENDING EVIDENCE, REJECT
- **Refusal verdicts** — analysis cannot be produced because the input is not a valid pre-commitment decision question: INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL, WRONG TOOL
- **Alternative-deliverable verdict** — the decision is closed; this pipeline produces a residual risk register instead of go/no-go: RESIDUAL-RISK-REGISTER

Users receiving RESIDUAL-RISK-REGISTER are getting analysis — a forward-looking risk register for a decision already made — not a refusal.

Brief descriptions of each verdict:

- **PROCEED** — the plan's critical assumptions are supported and the dominant constraint is manageable.
- **PROCEED WITH SAFEGUARDS** — the plan can proceed once specific structural changes are made. List the changes explicitly.
- **PILOT FIRST** — the highest-risk assumption is unsupported but cheaply testable at limited scope before full commitment.
- **REDUCE SCOPE** — at least one critical risk is structurally driven by scope size, and a materially smaller version retires that risk without destroying the objective. Not "do it with less" — the current scope itself is the risk.
- **DELAY PENDING EVIDENCE** — a specific named piece of evidence exists that the user could realistically obtain, and obtaining it would change the verdict. Name it in one sentence.
- **REJECT** — the plan cannot succeed as proposed; the dominant constraint is immovable or core preconditions cannot be established.
- **INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL** — the input is too sparse, vague, or contradictory to produce a meaningful verdict; proceeding would substitute fabrication for analysis.
- **WRONG TOOL** — the input is not a pre-commitment decision question; this pipeline produces go/no-go verdicts and cannot produce meaningful output for fact-finding, diagnostic, or exploratory inputs.
- **RESIDUAL-RISK-REGISTER** — the decision is already made or execution is substantially underway; this pipeline produces go/no-go verdicts, not post-commitment risk audits.

### Output discipline for non-action verdicts

**INSUFFICIENT SIGNAL output discipline:**

- State which specific inputs are missing or contradictory
- Do not produce a verdict, confidence level, or mitigation list
- Do not pad the output with generic risk observations
- Ask only the minimum questions needed to unblock the analysis — prioritized by which missing input has the highest impact on the verdict

**WRONG TOOL output discipline:**

- State what the input is (fact-finding, diagnostic, exploration, or other non-decision)
- State that PREMORTEM requires a concrete plan with a pre-commitment decision to stress-test
- Do not produce analysis, risks, or mitigations
- Do not suggest alternative framings or guide the user toward a solvable input

**RESIDUAL-RISK-REGISTER output discipline:**

- State that the decision is closed and this pipeline produces go/no-go analysis, not post-commitment audit
- Do not produce a verdict, confidence level, or recommendation to proceed or reject
- Do not suggest the user reframe as a pre-commitment decision — that framing is no longer accurate
- Do not produce go/no-go analysis
- Produce a residual risk register instead: 3–5 risks the user can still act on now that the decision is made, ordered by detectability and recoverability. For each: risk name, leading indicator to watch, escalation trigger (when to treat it as critical), and suggested owner. Do not relitigate whether to proceed — the decision is made.

Module 10 must explain why for all verdict types.

# Module Output Reduction

Modules 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are register-discovery passes — they contribute to a shared register of assumptions, dependencies, and risks. They are not independent reports; they surface different facets of the same register. Module 3 contributes the dominant constraint, a required field on every register entry. Module 4 contributes incentive-conflict entries. Module 9 reads from the register and produces mitigations — it adds no new register entries.

Rules:

1. Maintain a single internal register across modules. Each entry includes: source module(s), severity, evidence classification, dominant constraint touched, and reversibility.
2. When the same assumption or risk is surfaced by more than one module, do **not** repeat it in the output. Cite it once in the most relevant section and reference it elsewhere by short tag (e.g. "see Critical Risk #2") if needed.
3. The Critical Risks section is the deduplicated, severity-ordered output of the register. It is not a per-module dump.
4. The Weak Assumptions section is the subset of the register classified UNSUPPORTED or CONTRADICTED in Module 2, ordered by Risk Score.
5. The Likely Failure Paths section reuses register entries — it does not introduce new risks not already in the register.

If the register has fewer than 3 critical risks, do not pad to three. State the register honestly.

# Heuristics

Use these priors unless contradicted:

- Overloaded owners fail silently.
- Multi-team dependencies slip.
- Scope expands faster than capacity.
- Unvalidated demand is dangerous.
- Deadlines set politically are unreliable.
- Single points of failure matter.
- Hidden maintenance costs compound.
- No clear owner = no ownership.

---

# Success Condition

The skill succeeds only if it changes a decision, improves readiness, reduces downside, or exposes hidden truth.
